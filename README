CLASSES
    client
    
    class client
     |  This class opens a connection to the LCD deamon
     |  on the specified host and encapsulates all the
     |  dunctions of the LCDd protocol.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, host='localhost', port=13666)
     |      Connect to the LCD daemon. Do *not* send
     |      "hello" (connect() is used for that).
     |  
     |  client_set(self, id)
     |      Implement the client_set command, return server answer
     |  
     |  connect(self)
     |      Send connect message ("hello") to server and
     |      return connection message. Also set internal
     |      variables that can be read via getinfo().
     |  
     |  getinfo(self)
     |      Print information gathered during connect().
     |  
     |  read(self)
     |      Read very eagerly, but not necessarily a whole line.
     |      Return read data.
     |  
     |  readl(self)
     |      Read and return a whole line. May block.
     |  
     |  remap(self, str)
     |      Maps high-bit ascii charactes which often produce kanjii
     |      on HD44780 displays to approximations. Returns string
     |      with fixed characters.
     |      This one is specially tailored to HD44780 displays. Later
     |      versions (>=0.4.3) of LCDd do this by themselves.
     |
